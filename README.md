# Drawing-Figures

This program uses a GUI to allow the user to pick what figure and color they want to draw. Once the user has picked a figure and color, they can then draw the figure on the canvas to the left by left click the mouse then dragging it and releasing to draw the shape. The program use serialization to save any previous figures drawn, so that when the program closes and opens up again the user can continue where they left off.
